### **Assigment 4:**

Given the dataset called "vehicles.csv":

1.	Train a neural network, using the Keras framework, that allows estimating the price of a vehicle based on the same features used in the already calculated model.

2.	Evaluate the performance of the model based on the relationship of the metrics used and the cost function over epochs and iterate it:

a. Increase complexity (number of neurons, layers)

b. Test at least 3 optimizers.

c. Evaluate using scaled / unscaled data.

d. Increase the number of training epochs.

e. Incorporate early stopping into the training function.


3.	Obtain conclusions both on the best configuration for the model in question, as well as in its comparison with the already trained model in the notebook as a baseline.
