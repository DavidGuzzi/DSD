### **Assigment 3:**

Description: Customer segmentation is a process through which customers are classified into different groups that share similar characteristics in such a way that the results are relevant for specific actions, such as marketing campaigns. The characteristics used to describe each customer can be age, gender, interests, consumption habits, among others. 

Instructions: 

The main objectives of the project are two:

1.	Identify the customer base with the highest potential for product sales;
2.	Implement clustering algorithms to segment the customer base. 

The dataset to work with is called "Mall_Customers.csv". 

The work must include:

1. Exploratory data analysis: 

a. Description of the variables; 

b. Verify if there are missing values and outliers; 

c. Necessary visualizations to understand the data; 

d. Distribution analysis and correlation analysis of the variables.

2. Modeling: 

a. Select the variables for subsequent clustering; 

b. Evaluate and perform necessary variable transformations (e.g. standardization, normalization, etc.); 

c. Apply K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering (include dendrogram); 

d. Analyze the feasibility of applying dimensionality reduction. Test the effect on the mentioned algorithms; 

e. Describe the obtained clusters and give them meaningful names/labels; f. Report the results of the three final models, including justification for the chosen hyperparameters and for the variables used.
