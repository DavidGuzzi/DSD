#### **Assignment 2:**

The data used corresponds to the customers of a credit card from a bank, and the dataset to be used is called "BankChurners.csv".

The objective of the project is to predict those customers with a higher propensity to cancel the bank's credit card, which is known as Churn. In other words, predict the value of the Attrition_Flag column.
The work should include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

a. Answer some general questions about the domain. For example: Number of people who cancel the card according to their income, or dependents. Average age of customers, most frequent educational level, etc.

b. Null Value Analysis. Note: null values are presented with the word "unknown".

c. Outlier Analysis

d. Categorical Variable Transformation. Evaluate when to use one hot encoding or label encoding.

e. Distribution Analysis and Variable Correlation Analysis

2. Divide the data into training and test sets. Work with the training set. Evaluate class imbalance, try to make a more equitable balance, try to bring it to 50-50. (Oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE)

3. Train 3 classification models. Use k-fold techniques and grid search to find the best hyperparameters.

4. Report the results of each model (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F-score). Include confusion matrix. Select the best model based on the analysis of the metrics.

5. This point is optional: Include some Explainability graphics.
